        <p>The following letters were recovered from the belongings of surveyor Marshall Kline, 
            who was contracted to assess land conditions in the rural area known as “Old Mother’s Glen”. 
            The town has since been marked as “abandoned.”</p>

    <p>October 3rd, 1997.</p> 
        <p class="dialogue">"I arrived in the town of Old Mother’s Glen at 6:30 AM. 
            It’s out in the middle of nowhere, and it seems like fog practically sticks to the road. 
            Houses are nailed shut from the inside, and the few folks I’ve seen wear heavy coats… 
            In the middle of ninety degree heat. I saw the massive orchard fields on the drive in, and they are truly impressive; 
            rows upon rows of thicket and dead trees, lined with swamp flowers. T
            hen, there’s the scarecrows. They come in pairs of two, and they have their hands sewn together.” 
            <br>Addendum: “When I drove past last, the heads turned to follow me.”</p>
	<p>October 5th, 1997.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I asked the locals about the scarecrows. 
            Getting responses was difficult, as it seems nobody wants to interact with people outside of the community. 
            The children in particular don’t talk whatsoever, but simply hum a nursery rhyme of some sort. 
            I’ve never heard the words.” 
            <br>Addendum: “Finally, after way too much asking, I finally got an elderly man named Thom. 
            He told me that the orchard has a main epicenter, called “The Scarecrow Queen”. 
            He told me: “Don’t look ‘er in the flame. If you see her burnin’, it’s too late.” What a strange thing to say…”</p>
	<p>October 7th, 1997.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"I found the monument that was discussed by Thom. It’s a massive grave site, 
            with the largest scarecrow I’ve seen. It’s overrun with vines, and has a burlap and rotted silk dress on. 
            It also has this straw-bound face, with a crooked mouth. 
            This must be the Queen herself. She stands over a gravestone that says: 
            “Buried in her Sunday Best. May the soil hold her fast.” 
            There is no name listed in the stone, just roots that have taken the grave entirely.  
            It seems like… There’s a flame inside the eyes of the head. 
            It also has some kind of hammer in its hand—made from a ruined lantern.”</p>
	<p>October 10th, 1997.</p> 
        <p class="dialogue">"The children disappeared last night. The orchard lit up like a beacon at midnight, 
            like fireflies crawling from the ground. But it wasn’t fire… It was her. I saw The Scarecrow Queen, 
            floating and skidding across the cobbled ground. Her head was fully alight, and—”</p>

    <p>The notes end here, and the last pages were burnt. 
        A newspaper clipping was recovered from the local area from that day:</p>
	<p class="dialogue">“Town Lit Up! Local swamp-town “Old Mother’s Glen” burnt to the ground, 
        as a rogue spark caused the old infrastructure to catch fire. 
        No locals were hurt, but anthropologist Marshall Kline’s body was identified and discovered in the swamp. 
        Though he was burnt by the wildfire, Kline’s body was also bludgeoned by some form of metal club as well. 
        No charges were pressed, but local authorities are currently in pursuit of the assailant.”</p>
