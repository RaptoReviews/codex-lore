        <p>The following reports were gathered from the western lighthouse, known as <em>“Mockingbird Point”</em>, 
            from the year 1974.</p>
        <hr style="border-color: var(--accent-bronze); margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        <p>Thursday, August 22, 1974.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"We have just arrived at the lighthouse, right off the western coast of Kings Watch. 
            We’re about three hours away from the town by boat, 
            and have enough provisions to get through ‘till the start of the new year. 
            Apparently, whoever owns this place is paying peanuts for its upkeep. 
            The masonry is decrepit, and it seems like it’s about to cave in any day now. 
            Still, it’s work. These days, that’s enough I suppose. Myself, along with my colleagues, 
            Sebastian and Christoph, are set to keep watch. Hey, at least we have each other. Right?”</p>
        <p>Thursday, September 19, 1974.</p> 
            <p class="dialogue">"It’s been about a month at the lighthouse. 
            Apparently, it’s called “Mockingbird Point”. Something to do with birds, 
            I think. Regardless, the place is a mess. The equipment barely works, 
            and what little that does function is rusted and worn out. 
            Sebastian’s been saying a storm is coming in, but he’s been saying that for a week now. 
            And so far? Nothing. Christoph is worried, but I’m more irritated than anything. 
            Barely any ships come through Kings Watch anyway. What’s there to do?”
        <br>Addendum: “Sebastian was right. A shock snow storm just started pelting the lighthouse. 
            Handbook says to stay inside until it clears.”</p>
        <p>Wednesday, October 23, 1974.</p> 
        <p class="dialogue">"Sebastian is gone. He was here last night, but has wandered off. 
            We found footprints in the frost, ‘seems like he went to the ocean last night. Barefoot. 
            We have no way to contact the mainland, so me and Christoph are the only ones who know right now. 
            Apparently. Sebastian was saying something about “Her”, saying he’s hearing voices. 
            I paid it no mind, but now…” 
        <br>Addendum: “It’s been a few days since the last log, and Christoph has started to say… Concerning things. 
            He says that he knows where Sebastian went, and that we should bring him back.”</p>
        <p>Monday, December 2, 1974.</p> 
        <p class="dialogue">“Christoph has lost his mind. He’s been screaming on the beach all morning. 
            He’s calling out to Sebastian, trying to bring him back. 
            I can see his skin, and it’s turning black from the cold. He refuses to come inside, 
            and has become violent when I physically move him. I-”</p>
        <p>The entry is cut short, and continues.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“I just watched Christoph dive into the ocean. He was completely nude, 
            and his digits looked like they were falling off. I tried to stop him, but he refuses to come up for air…” 
        <br>Addendum: “... Christoph must be dead. It’s midnight, and he’s still not back. I’m all alone now.
            Another storm is coming in, even worse than the September storm.”
        <br>Addendum: “There’s someone else here. I hear a woman’s voice.”</p>
