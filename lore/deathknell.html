        <p>Blood.</p>
        <p>Blood, dripping from the blade of orichalcum and bone, clatters against the polished stone floor. 
        Heaving of breath, dark and gruff. With silver strands of loose hair falling in the front of the ghastly visage, 
        the hulking man collapses to one knee. In front of his eyes, soldiers of the invading Atalum Dynasty—assassins, 
        cutthroats, and sellswords alike, whose bodies are now less than dust beneath the dark gray skyline. 
        Cries emanate from the opposed chambers, as the lumbering man stumbles through the doors. 
        Swinging open the chamber room, seeing the sights of horror and despair itself. 
        Queen Beorhtwynn holds the lithe, motionless body of her eldest son, Prince Alric in her arms. 
        Tears stream down her eyes, as she sobs into her son’s chest. Beorhtwynn looks up, seeing her husband, 
        King Einhard, watching them from the doorway.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“They… They killed him… My poor boy…”</p>
        <p>Einhard stumbles into the room, as he falls to his knees. His orichalcum greatblade falling to the floor, 
        as he cradles his son’s head in his large hand.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“... Alric… My son…”</p>
        <p>Einhard looks to the sky, as he lets out a guttural, pained cry to the heavens. 
        The heavens that answer not more than silent death. Beorhtwynn is broken at the sight, 
        as she watches the two men of her life dead and broken. Small footsteps enter the space, 
        as a light voice is heard.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Mommy…? Daddy…?”</p>
        <p>Princess Godwyna, with golden curls of long hair, watches her parents mourn their lost son—her lost brother. 
        Beorhtwynn stands, and stumbles to her daughter to shield her eyes.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Godwyna… Turn thine eyes…”</p>
        Godwyna looks, seeing the pain and agony, as her brother lays slain upon the floor. 
        She cries, as she hugs into her mothers legs. Staining her white and emerald dress…</p>
        <p>Years later. Darkness seeps into the halls of Boltangate Castle, 
            as King Einhard sits upon his throne of dark stone. The halls of brass and silk, 
            adorned with the soldiers of Einhard’s personal guard. Queen Beorhtwynn strides to her husband’s throne, 
            with the face of pale death affixed.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Einhard… This musn’t happen. Thine grief, sorrow… I feel them in my heart… 
            But a decree to “outlaw death itself”? This is a spit upon the divine!”</p>
        <p>Einhard looks down on the Queen, as his gravelly voice escapes his throat.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Thou should be grateful, Beorhtwynn… My decree shall avenge Alric’s name… 
        Be merry, my love. For death carry no quarter in my halls.”</p>
        <p>Beorhtwynn scowls at the King, her eyes narrow.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Nay, this is not vengeance for our boy… This is treason on life itself…”</p>
        <p>Einhard stands swiftly, as his loud voice carries through the hall.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Bite your tongue, or it shall be stripped from thee!”</p>
        <p>Einhard limbers down the stairs to his throne, as his bronze and chain armor clatters upon his body.</p> 
            <p p class="dialogue">“I… Am Einhard, son of Wulfgar. <em>‘Die Alpha Wolf’</em>, and soon… 
            The man who will conquer death…”</p> 
        <p>He then leans close, his face mere inches from Beorhtwynn.</p> 
            <p class="dialogue">“And if you stand opposed, then treason’s name be put upon ye…”</p>
        <p>Beorhtwynn looks down. Her eyes fall, as her gaze falters.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“... Thou would put me to death? For opposing madness?”</p>
        <p>Einhard backs off, as he walks back to his throne. The orichalcum blade stabbed into the apex.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“... I would do anything to protect my people. 
            And death is no longer welcome in these hallowed halls… I will not have it…”</p>
        <p>Beorhtwynn turns away.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">“Then may death claim me, before thou takest my soul…”</p>
        <p>Beorhtwynn walks away, as Einhard looks down at the floor. 
        When the Queen is gone, he screams out and grabs his stone throne, tossing it into a wall. 
        Shrapnel of stone strewn around, as his blade falls to the ground.</p>    
            <p class="dialogue">“... Death… Is now outlawed… Any who are seen opposed, will have their souls kept and returned. 
            Whether they wish it, or not…”</p>
